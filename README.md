# pycon-t-strings-lightning

This repository contains the [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/) slide deck for [Dave's](https://davepeck.org/about/) upcoming lightning talk about PEP 750 at Pycon US 2025.

I learned the hard way that `sli.dev` is a pretty difficult tool to work with, and &mdash; despite claims to the contrary &mdash; really wants you to have a single slide deck per repository. (Just _try_ using their `vscode` extension in a repository with more than one slide deck, I dare you!) So, I decided to make a new repository for just this talk.

### Details

To start the slide show:

- `npm install`
- `npm dev`
- visit <http://localhost:3030>

Edit the [slides.md](./slides.md) to see the changes.
