# Who am I?

Hi, I'm **Dave Peck**.

I'm an independent software developer based in sunny Seattle, Washington.

<!--
"independent software developer" is what you say in polite company when you mean "software weirdo who works from home and doesn't have a boss"

I have spent most of my career in the Seattle startup community, and have spent
the last two years working on civic technology projects in tandem with nonprofits
and local government.

But enough about me!
